/**
 * Righteous MIMES: Extensions by Type
 *
 * Almost all of the effort works the other way around — you start with
 * an extension and then proceed to discover type — but if a file has
 * no extension or its content-based type doesn't match, it can be
 * useful to work at it from the other direction.
 *
 * Note: This file is generated automatically; do not edit by hand
 * unless you plan to make a habit of it.
